If your company has embedded pyexcel and its components into a revenue generating
product, please support me on github, or `patreon <https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=5537627>`_
maintain the project and develop it further.

With your financial support, I will be able to invest a little bit more time in coding,
documentation and writing interesting posts.
